/// a smart contract to receive ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens.
///
/// Flow contracts are expected to be deployed via. a proxy/factory as clones
/// of an implementation contract. This makes flows cheap to deploy and every
/// flow contract can be initialized with a different set of flows. This gives
/// strong guarantees that the flow contract is only capable of evaluating
/// registered flows, and that individual flow contracts cannot collide state
/// with each other, given a correctly implemented interpreter store. Combining
/// proxies with rainlang gives us a very powerful and flexible system for
/// composing flows without significant gas overhead. Typically a flow contract
/// deployment will cost well under 1M gas, which is very cheap for bespoke
/// logic, without significant runtime overheads. This allows for new UX patterns
/// where users can cheaply create many different tools such as NFT mints,
/// auctions, escrows, etc. and aim to horizontally scale rather than design
/// monolithic protocols.
///
/// This does NOT implement the preview and flow logic directly because each
/// flow implementation has different requirements for the mint and burn logic
/// of the flow tokens. In the future, this may be refactored so that a single
/// flow contract can handle all flows.
///
/// `FlowCommon` is `Multicall` so it is NOT compatible with receiving ETH. This
/// is because `Multicall` uses `delegatecall` in a loop which reuses `msg.value`
/// for each loop iteration, effectively "double spending" the ETH it receives.
/// This is a known issue with `Multicall` so in the future, we may refactor
/// `FlowCommon` to not use `Multicall` and instead implement flow batching
/// directly in the flow contracts.
